# ðŸ’¾ Server

**General Overview**

The index.js file uses [`express`](https://expressjs.com/),  [`crypto`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html), [`mongodb`](https://www.mongodb.com/), and other modules to handle syncing data between Wrike and SharePoint.

## **Middleware**

* **Rate Limiting (**[**`limiter`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit)**)**: Prevents DDoS attacks by limiting the number of requests to the server.
* **Request Validation**: Validates incoming request headers using [`express-validator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator).
* **Custom Middleware**&#x20;
  * **`addAPIIdToReq`**: Adds API ID to the request for specific routes, this is required because Wrike's webhooks (as of Jan 2024) use the V3 ID for users instead of V4. Every user has 2 different Wrike ID's, one for the webhooks, and one for everything else.

## **Security**

* **Hash Verification**: Utilizes [`crypto`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) to verify the integrity and origin of the data.
* **Environment Variables**: Stores sensitive information like API keys and database URLs in environment variables.
* **MongoDB Client**: Securely connects to MongoDB databases for CRUD operations.
* **Rate Limiting**: Protects against brute-force attacks.
* **Wrike secret:** Each webhook set up with a specific security key to verify the http request has come from Wrike. To verify this we capture the raw body data in /wrike/\* and store it, then we convert the body to JSON. Finally, we create a SHA256 HMAC using the security key and check that against the X-Hook-Secret header that was sent. If it matches then we know it came from Wrike.
* **Graph validation token:** Each subscription (same as a webhook) is set up with a validation token which is then checked, if it exists in the header, it probably came from graph (if it's https only!)

## **Additional Notes**

* **Error Handling**: Most routes include try-catch blocks to handle exceptions, with error logging and appropriate HTTP response codes.
* **Logging**: Systematic logging is implemented, particularly for error scenarios, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
* **Security**: The application heavily relies on environment variables for sensitive data, ensuring that API keys, database URLs, and other critical information are not exposed in the code.
